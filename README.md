Remix Playground
A personal playground to play with all things Remix. That includes:

- Different stacks
- Libary integratinos
- Remix primitives
- etc.

It's a messy repo and it's meant to serve as a personal scratchpad for learning. Feel free to clone, edit, contribute or whatever you want to do.

It's main purpose is to exist as a consequence free playground for practice and learning.

Setup
It's setup as a monorepo using pnpm because I don't like having a million different repos. There is a main project at root which you can simply use as a template for new projects.

Each project is a bit different but most of them just use the `Remix Server` template. Which is just a packaged express server.

If you want to create a new project just add it in the pnpm-workspace.yaml, check out the packages installed at root and install whatever packages you find necessary in your project directory.


Go play, have fun and learn.
